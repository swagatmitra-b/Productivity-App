
## Hacktoberfest Contributions

Hello! It's great to see you interested in helping me fix this little project. This may be the perfect repo for you to contribute to if you're someone with a decent understanding of HTML/CSS or JavaScript. Beginner or not, everyone is welcome :)

1. Feel free to take your time and understand the codebase. Before starting out with anything else, please read the README file to gain an overview of the application. The app was built using vanilla JavaScript so even if you're a beginner with little to no experience with frontend frameworks, you should feel right at home!

2. Create a fork of this repository and clone your forked repo on your local machine. You can set the upstream of your remote to my repo. Always remember to create a separate branch for any change you may make in the codebase. You can name your branch as per your will, but it is encouraged to stick to this convention. 
    ```bash 
    git branch hack/fix-name
    ```
    `fix-name` could be anything related to your changes. Finally, when opening Pull Requests, remember to change the base (the target branch you want to merge your branch into) to the `hacktoberfest` branch. Also, don't forget to mention the issue number if you fix an issue!

3. You are welcome to go through the issues in the Issues section and work on them according to your preference. Leave a comment asking me to assign a particular issue to you. If you happen to find bugs yourself, please raise an issue.

4. For maintaining a clean commit history, please try to keep your commit messages as consise as possible. 

4. Please remember to pull from the main branch of your upstream (my repo) before pushing your changes to your branch, considering your branch is based off the main branch which is almost always the case. This is considered good practice since it helps catch merge conflicts early.

5. I'm looking forward to your active contributions. Good luck and have fun!
